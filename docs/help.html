   This is AreaPilot.  These listings you see on the front page are upcoming events that other users have posted.  If you've used news aggregate sites like Reddit, Digg or Slashdot you already know what to do.  The only difference is that AreaPilot is an event aggregator<br />


   <br />
   <a class="faq_answer" name="What-are-these-numbers-next-to-the-events">What are these numbers next to the events?</a><br />
   Those numbers on the front page are the number of users that like or are planning on attending the event.  The more people that like the event, the higher up on the list it gets.  Clicking on the <font style="font-style: italic">I Like It</font> button or the <font style="font-style: italic">Attend This Event</font> link will add to its rating.<br />

   Up at the top of the page in the header is a menu where you can select categories or sub-categories to view.  Clicking on the <font style="font-weight: bold">Comedy</font> menu link will display all events (within your date range) posted in the Comedy category or any of it's sub-categories.  If you decide to select <font style="font-weight: bold">Stand Up</font> on the Comedy sub-menu, you will only see the events that are Stand Up comedy events.<br />

   <a class="faq_answer" name="Whats-up-with-all-these-dates">What's up with all these dates?</a><br />
   By default when you visit AreaPilot, you'll only see the events for the current week.  Well what if you want to view events for next week, next month, or just today?  We've got you covered.  The <font style="font-style: italic">Date Menu</font> is just above the listings.  With this menu we have some common defaults to select from such as <font style="font-style: italic">This Week</font> or even <font style="font-style: italic">Next Month</font>.<br />
   Below that are specific dates you can search in case you're specifically looking to find out what's going on this Friday.  On either side of the dates you'll see &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; links.  You can click these to display more dates to select from.<br />
   We also have the <font style="font-style: italic">Select Date Range</font> link which allows you to select your own date range.  Clicking this will popup a calendar.  The first date you should pick is the start range (example: April 1), the calendar will then reload and you can pick an end date (example: April 15).  Once you've selected your date range, the page will reload showing you events between April 1st and April 15th.<br />

   Absolutely.  All you need to do is create an account.  Once you've logged into your account you'll see the "Post Event" link up at the top.  Just click that and enter the event details.<br />

   Events are ordered by the number of people who like them.  Well mostly.  Once we add up how many people like an event, we throw that number into a magic box and get a similar number back but modified slightly for our own evil purposes.<br />
