</head>

<body>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you hate it when you decide to go attend some event and no one is there? Well AreaPilot is an attempt to solve that problem.  AreaPilot allows you to post events that you hear about and allows the community to vote on their favorites and mark which events they plan on attending.  The favorites will go to the top of the list so when the time comes for the event, you can get an idea of how many people are going to be at the event.<br />
   <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow your friends profiles to find out where they're going to be this Friday by viewing their profile or notify friends that you're going to be going somewhere and they should come with you.  With the <font style="font-style: italic">Facebook Like</font> and the <font style="font-style: italic">Twitter Share</font> buttons you can let friends on other sites know that you like the event as well.
