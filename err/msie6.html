	 We're sorry! AreaPilot does not support Internet Explorer 6.<br />
	 <br />
	 Did you know that IE6 is 10 years old?  That means you've been looking at the web the way it looked a decade ago!  For the best results viewing this site download and install either <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fx/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.  Upgrading to one of these browsers will also improve the security on your computer to help protect you from all the virus and worms that a 10 year old web browser is susceptible to.<br />
	 <br />
	 You can also upgrade to a newer version of internet explorer to view the site, however the site will look better using one of the browsers listed above.
